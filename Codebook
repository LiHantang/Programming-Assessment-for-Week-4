As you can see, there are 77 variables in the final data set:
1. Labels marking test subjects and activites:
  -subject
  -activity
2. Triaxial readings from sensors of the phone
  -body_acc_x_value            
  -body_acc_y_value           
  -body_acc_z_value            
  -body_gyro_x_value           
  -body_gyro_y_value          
  -body_gyro_z_value          
  -total_acc_x_value           
  -total_acc_y_value 
  -total_acc_z_value
  
  The meaning of these variables is well stated in the text file.
  total_acc_x: The average acceleration signal from the smartphone accelerometer X axis in standard gravity units 'g'. And
  total_acc_y and total_acc_z are for the Y and Z axis. 

  body_acc_x: The average of the total body acceleration signal obtained by subtracting the gravity from the total
  acceleration. 

  body_gyro_x.txt: The average angular velocity vector measured by the gyroscope for each window sample. The units are
  radians/second.

3. Some features from the 561-feature data set
Feature Selection 
=================

The features selected for this database come from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ. These time domain signals (prefix 't' to denote time) were captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz. Then they were filtered using a median filter and a 3rd order low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 20 Hz to remove noise. Similarly, the acceleration signal was then separated into body and gravity acceleration signals (tBodyAcc-XYZ and tGravityAcc-XYZ) using another low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 0.3 Hz. 

Subsequently, the body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to obtain Jerk signals (tBodyAccJerk-XYZ and tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ). Also the magnitude of these three-dimensional signals were calculated using the Euclidean norm (tBodyAccMag, tGravityAccMag, tBodyAccJerkMag, tBodyGyroMag, tBodyGyroJerkMag). 

Finally a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied to some of these signals producing fBodyAcc-XYZ, fBodyAccJerk-XYZ, fBodyGyro-XYZ, fBodyAccJerkMag, fBodyGyroMag, fBodyGyroJerkMag. (Note the 'f' to indicate frequency domain signals). 

These signals were used to estimate variables of the feature vector for each pattern:  
'-XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.

tBodyAcc-XYZ
tGravityAcc-XYZ
tBodyAccJerk-XYZ
tBodyGyro-XYZ
tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ
tBodyAccMag
tGravityAccMag

tBodyGyroMag
tBodyGyroJerkMag
fBodyAcc-XYZ
fBodyAccJerk-XYZ
fBodyGyro-XYZ

The set of variables that were estimated from these signals are: 

mean(): Mean value
std(): Standard deviation
